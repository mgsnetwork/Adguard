# Shelly DNS whitelist (AdGuard Home style)
# Purpose: allow Shelly cloud services and update/mqtt endpoints so Shelly devices and apps keep working.
# Notes:
# - Top section: AdGuard / AdGuard Home filter syntax (use as a filter list or "Allowlist" filter)
#   Use these rules in AdGuard Home under Filters -> Custom filtering rules (or import as a filter list).
# - Bottom section: plain domain list (one domain per line) â€” use this for AdGuard Home DNS -> Whitelist import.
# - Review these entries against your network logs / device console and add any additional vendor endpoints you find.

# === Tips ===
# - If you use strict blocking (e.g., blocklists that block many third-party CDNs), check device logs for any other hosts (CDNs or update servers)
#   the devices contact (e.g., raw.githubusercontent.com, cdn.*) and add them only if necessary and trusted.
# - If your Shelly devices use local LAN discovery, keep mDNS/UPnP allowed on the LAN; this whitelist only affects DNS resolution.
# - If you'd like, I can convert this into a single-line host file, an AdGuard Home uploaded filter list, or push it to your repo.
